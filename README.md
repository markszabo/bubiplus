## Planned features
### Achievements (badges)
Award the users badges based on their trips (similar gamification logic like [Nike+](http://howtonike.blogspot.com/2012/12/nike-trophies-collection.html)). All badges have three levels: bronze, silver, gold with more associated effort (usually more qualifying trip needed).

* "In a row" type badges
  * 5, 10, 30 days in a row
  * 3, 5, 10 weeks in a row
  * 3, 6, 12 months in a row
* "Times a week/month/year" type badges
  * 3, 5, 7 times a week
  * 10, 20, 30 times a month
  * 30, 100, 300 times a year
* "Part of the day" type badges
  * Dawn - 5, 10, 50 times between 3 - 6 am
  * Party guy - 5, 10, 50 times between 11 pm - 3 am
* Location based
  * 1873 - Merge of Pest, Buda & Óbuda. 5, 10, 50 trips crossing the Danube
  * Tourist - 5, 10, 50 trips touching one of the following sites: Hősök tere, TODO
